# Autonomous Robot Warehouse Simulation

This project simulates an autonomous robot navigating a 10x10 meter warehouse environment, built using Python and Pygame. The robot moves from a starting point to a specified target while respecting movement constraints and periodically stopping.

## Features
- Simulates robot movement with speed and stopping intervals.
- Avoids warehouse boundaries.
- Demonstrates basic robotic navigation in a grid-based environment.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
